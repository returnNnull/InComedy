# InComedy Product Brief

## One-liner

Chat-first platform for standup events where audience, comedians, and organizers interact around real events.

## Problem

- Audience has fragmented discovery, ticketing, and communication.
- Organizers handle applications and lineup updates manually across multiple tools.
- Comedians lack a single channel to apply, coordinate, and monetize (donations).

## Core Roles

1. Audience
2. Comedian
3. Organizer

## Core Flows

1. Audience discovers events by city, books seat, buys ticket, joins event chat, sends donations.
2. Organizer creates event, manages applications, confirms lineup, communicates updates in event chat.
3. Comedian applies to events, receives status, joins coordination chat, receives donations.

## Product Principle

- Chat is not a side feature; every event has a dedicated chat as a primary interaction layer.

## MVP Scope

- Role-based onboarding.
- Event creation and discovery.
- Ticket purchase and reservation.
- Event chat.
- Comedian application and organizer approval.
- Basic donation flow.

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Advanced recommendation engine.
- Deep analytics dashboards.
- Complex payout splitting logic.

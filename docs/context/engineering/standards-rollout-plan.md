# Standards Rollout Plan

This file defines phased adoption of standards.

## Phase 1 (MVP-critical)

- Clean + MVI compliance.
- Koin DI usage.
- Mandatory feature test minimums.
- CI quality gates for required checks.
- Context update discipline (`decisions-log`, `session-log`, `backlog`).

## Phase 2 (post-MVP hardening)

- Extended performance budgets and dashboards.
- Expanded accessibility/localization checks.
- Advanced observability and alerting coverage.
- Strict release governance and deprecation policy.

## Rule

- New standards must be assigned to a phase before becoming mandatory.
